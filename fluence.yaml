# This is like the "main" Aqua file, but
# mostly it just points to the vague location of the code
#
# Theoretically, only that file and its imports (including transitives) will be compiled.
# But in practice it seems to be unstable, changing unpredictably.
aquaInputPath: src/aqua/decider/poll.aqua

# To fight the aforementioned unpredictability, I set these imports explicitly.
# I consider this a temporary hack to hotfix bug with compilation scopes, until it is fixed.
aquaImports:
  - src/aqua
